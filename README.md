# Predictive Model: Retirement Plan Algorithm

This repository showcases a predictive modeling algorithm for forecasting retirement savings. The model uses a linear regression algorithm to predict expected savings based on age, annual contributions, and years to retirement.

## Files
- `predictive_model.py`: The main script containing the predictive model.
- `retirement_model.pkl`: The trained model saved as a pickle file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the script.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-model-retirement-plan.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd predictive-model-retirement-plan`
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script: `python predictive_model.py`

## Dependencies
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Visualizations
The script includes a visualization of the predicted versus actual retirement savings to illustrate the model's performance.
